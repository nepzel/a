Normal distribution

i) lesser than:
pnorm(a,mean=Miu,sd=sigma)

ii) more than:

pnorm(a,mean=Miu,sd=sigma,lower.tail=FALSE)

iii) Betwwen or comparisions:
pnorm(b,mean=Miu,sd=sigma)-pnorm(a,mean=Miu,sd=sigma)

iv) over 1000:
over=pnorm(a,mean=Miu,sd=sigma,lower.tail=FALSE) #since a value here can be more than mean
print(over*1000)

v)below 1000:

below=pnorm(a,mean=Miu,sd=sigma)
print(below*1000)

(chocolate, vanilla, strawberry) gives the following results: 
Flavour 
Gender 
Chocolate Vanilla Strawberry Total

Women 350 200 90 640 
Total 450 320 150 920

t test one means:
Tests made on the breaking strength of 10 pieces of a metal gave the followingresults. 
578, 572, 570, 568, 572, 570, 570, 572, 596 and 584 kg.

t test 2 means:
6 subjects were given a drug (treatment group) and an additional 6 subjects a placebo (control 
group). Their reaction time to a stimulus was measured (in ms). 
Placebo group: 91, 87, 99, 77, 88, 91 
Treatment group : 101, 110, 103, 93, 99, 104 
Can we conclude that the reaction time of the placebo group is less than that of the treatment 
group? (Required table value of t = 1.1812) 
Null hypothesis ùêª‡¨¥: ùúá‡¨µ = ùúá‡¨∂, ie. the reaction times of the two groups are equal. 
Alternate hypothesisùêª‡¨µ: ùúá‡¨µ < ùúá‡¨∂ie, the reaction time of the placebo group is less than that of the 
treatment group 
R-code: 
 Control = c(91, 87, 99, 77, 88, 91) 
Treat = c(101, 110, 103, 93, 99, 104) 
t.test(Control,Treat,alternative="less", var.equal=TRUE) 
Conclusion: ùë° -value =-3.4456 ,|ùë°| =3.4456 > 1.1812. Hence we may conclude that the reaction time 
of placebo group is less than that of treatment group.
